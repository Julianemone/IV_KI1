# Introduction
June marks the month in which high school students in The Netherlands receive their graduation results. For many, the next step is to pursue higher education. In The Netherlands, higher education is divided into two types of universities: universities of applied sciences and research universities.  Choosing between these two paths can be challenging, as it is generally believed to significantly impact future job prospects and salary potential. But does this belief hold true in reality?

An individual's educational background typically influences their career path. It is commonly believed that higher education leads to better employment prospects and higher salaries. In Dutch higher education, there is ongoing debate about which type of university offers the best prospects. Some argue that universities of applied sciences (HBO) are superior because students at these institutions complete obligatory internships. This early work experience is seen as an advantage of HBO institutions over research universities (WO), as it makes candidates more attractive to employers. It is said that these graduates enjoy a higher employment rate compared to their WO counterparts. On the other hand, the status of the academic university - being seen as the highest achievable form of education in The Netherlands - makes some people argue that WO students will have a higher pay rate in their career than HBO students.

This data story intends to investigate and discuss the perspectives that focus on the differences between these forms of education, by visualising and analysing data about the employment positions and salaries of graduates. Through this, we hope to offer answers to this debate and clear up any misjudgements and prejudices about these different education paths.
