# Work Distribution
Our team primarily worked online, using video calls and text communication. In our initial meeting, we focused on finding interesting datasets and getting ideas based on the data. The following meeting, we organised the tasks necessary to realise our ideas. We then divided the workload and conducted several video calls to be more productive and efficient. In the final week, we incorporated feedback and worked on the finishing touches.

## Casper
Casper collaborated with Julia in creating figures and processing the data accordingly. He also wrote descriptions for figures. He put a lot of effort into making the line charts easy to read. For example, he selectively highlighted the most interesting data points to avoid overwhelming the reader with too many lines.

## Julia
Julia did the (pre)processing of the dataset. She collaborated with Casper on creating figures and wrote descriptions. She also added annotations to highlight certain data. Additionally, she was in charge of publishing the notebook, writing CSS to ensure it looked good and worked well in light and dark mode. 

## Cayran
Cayran focused on developing the storyline. He structured our story so that each section flowed logically and told a compelling story. Cayran also helped create the figures, collaborating with Casper and Julia to develop visualisations that supported our storyline. 

## Dani
Dani helped with the proposal and draft in checking spelling and the general gist of the project. He also helped create a figure.
