# Work Distribution
Our team primarily worked online, using video calls and text communication. In our initial meeting, we focused on finding interesting datasets and getting ideas based on the data. The following meeting, we organised our plan to realise our ideas. We then divided the workload and had video calls to be more productive and efficient. In the final week, we incorporated feedback and worked on the finishing touches.

## Casper
Casper collaborated with Julia in creating figures and descriptions. He also processed the data accordingly. He made the line charts easy to read. For example, he selectively highlighted the most interesting data points to avoid overwhelming the reader with too many lines.

## Julia
Julia did the (pre)processing of the dataset. She collaborated with Casper on creating figures and descriptions. She also added annotations to highlight certain data. Additionally, she published the notebook, writing CSS to ensure it looked good and worked in light and dark mode.

## Cayran
Cayran focused on developing the storyline. He structured our story so that each section flowed logically. Cayran also helped create the figures, collaborating with Casper and Julia to develop visualisations that supported our storyline.

## Dani
Dani helped with the proposal and draft, as well as helping create a line chart.
