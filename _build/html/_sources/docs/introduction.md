# Introduction
June marks the month in which high school students in The Netherlands receive their graduation results. For many, the next step is to pursue higher education. In the Netherlands, higher education is divided into two types of universities: universities of applied sciences and research universities.  Choosing between these two paths can be challenging, as it is believed to significantly impact future job prospects and salary potential. But does this belief hold true in reality?


In Dutch higher education, there is ongoing debate about which type of university offers the best prospects. Some argue that universities of applied sciences (hbo) are superior because their mandatory internships give students an early work experience advantage, leading to higher employment rates compared to research universities (wo). However, others believe that the prestigious status of research universities means wo-graduates will ultimately earn higher salaries.


This data story intends to investigate and discuss the perspectives that focus on the differences between these forms of education, by visualising and analysing data on graduates' employment positions and salaries. Through this analysis, we hope to offer insights into the debate and clear up any misconceptions about these educational paths.
