# Reflection

## Feedback:
The different feedback points we received from our TA were:
- That there is a lack of a clear narrative throughout the story.
- The point that is being made with the figures is not clear.

We also asked peers and family for feedback to make sure our story was pleasant and easy to read. They gave us these feedback points:
- The line charts are overwhelming because of the amount of data.
- Different lines have the same colour which is confusing.
- Our insights were unclear without looking at the text.

Based on this feedback we decided to add more information to our figures. We added descriptions to clarify the figures and a short subtitle to convey our insights. To emphasise important points we made selective highlights/annotations. This also made the figures less overwhelming and easier to read. We paid special attention to the line charts and decided to only initially show data we found interesting, while still allowing the reader to compare other data by clicking on the legend.

At the moment of feedback we hadn't finished writing the story but made sure to use the feedback while writing. We restructured the storyline a little, so that it was clear and cohesive from the beginning until the end.

## Self-reflection:
In hindsight it would've been a smoother process if we analysed the dataset more before creating the story and graphs. It would've made it easier to write a clear and cohesive storyline. Now we started creating figures without really knowing what we wanted to showcase exactly. Next time we would like to be more thorough in analysing the dataset beforehand. That way we would've also been able to start writing the story sooner.

Overall we enjoyed working together and had good communication.
